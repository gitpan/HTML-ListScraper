HTML-ListScraper

While Perl has good support and is often used for extracting
machine-friendly data from HTML pages, most scripts used for that task
are ad-hoc, parsing just one site's HTML and depending on superficial,
transient details of its structure - and are therefore brittle and
labor-intensive to maintain. This module tries to support more generic
scraping for a class of pages: those whose most important part is a
list of links.
