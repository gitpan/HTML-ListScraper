=head1 NAME

HTML::ListScraper::Tag - sequence item found by L<HTML::ListScraper>

=head1 METHODS

All documented methods are simple accessors, taking no arguments and
leaving the C<HTML::ListScraper::Tag> object unchanged.

=head2 name

Tag name. L<HTML::ListScraper> extends the L<HTML::Parser> convention
of naming tags in lowercase: closing tags are identified by a
prepended '/'. After that, the name itself consists of ASCII letters
and numbers. In case your input veers rather far from HTML, tags can
also contain '-' and ':', but no more exotic characters. Empty name is
not allowed. Angle brackets are not part of the name - if you need
them, you can always add them when formatting C<HTML::ListScraper>
output.

=head2 index

Tag position (zero-based).

=head2 link

Value of the C<href> attribute, if the parsed tag had a C<href>
attribute (with non-empty value). Otherwise, C<undef>.

=head2 text

Text following the tag, if any. Note that even closing tags can have
associated text, although in well-formed HTML, that text really
belongs under some previous opening tag.
